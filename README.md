# ViscoIndent
**Simulation and processing of indentation experiments**
1) Simulated force versus indentation curves for soft viscoelastic materials
2) Fitting of the experimental force versus indentation (time) curves with the selected viscoelastic models

Quick start:
1) For simulations launch graphical user interface with **ViscoIndent.py**
2) For processing of the experimental data launch graphical user interface with **ViscoIndent_dataGUI.py**

More description of the used parameters could be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70361-y
and in **ViscoIndent_documentation.pdf** file
