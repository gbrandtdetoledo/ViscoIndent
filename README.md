# ViscoIndent
1) Simulated force versus indentation curves for soft viscoelastic materials
2) Fitting of the experimental force versus indentation (time) curves with the selected viscoelastic models

Quick start:
1) for simulations launch graphical user interface with ViscoIndent.py
2) for processing of the experimental data launch graphical user interface with ViscoIndent_dataGUI.py

More description of the used parameters could be found at https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.15.041640v1
